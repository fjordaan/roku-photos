# Project description

This is a screensaver app to run on a Roku 3 set-top box.  
It displays photos stored on a Synology NAS connected to the same network.  
It is controlled by the Roku remote.  
The remote is used to step forward and back through photos, and also change the playlist and other settings via on-screen menus.

## Components

There will be 2 parts to the app:
- The Roku app, installed on the set-top box, that displays the photos and responds to user input from the remote control.
- The server app, running on the NAS, which creates playlists dynamically based on user choices.
